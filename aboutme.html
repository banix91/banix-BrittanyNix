      <h1>Get to Know Banix.</h1>
      <p>Banix was founded on the need of combining three impoartant elements: Design, Technology and
      communciation. Many times there is a disconnect when it comes to infromation and how to relay that
      information in a complete Package. Banix is the brain child of Brittany Nix. She has years of
      experience that ranges from Graphic Design, Web Devlopment/ Programming and Visual information
      specialities.</p>

      <p>"I have always struggled with finding a career path that allowed me to completely merge my two
        passions together which is that of Design and Technology. I felt myself having to forfiet one in order to pursue the other,
        with Banix I saw a need. A need to create a Visual and technical communciation company that would provide
        services from UI design to creating a branding for etsbalished and up and coming businesses. It feels good when
        you help people establish thier dreams and goals and Banix wants to help you accomplish those dreams".</p>
